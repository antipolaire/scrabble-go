There's nothing better than exploring french countryside in a campingvan, drinking excellent wine and writing some GO code just for fun. In this case and somewhat unexpectedly, I decided to implement a scrabble game. It is not finished and not perfect, but I had lot's of fun and learned a lot about GO and GUI programming in general.
